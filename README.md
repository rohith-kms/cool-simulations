# A few cool simulations
Hey there! This is a collection of cool Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) based simulations that I made while learning these concepts. Hope you'll enjoy them as much as I did.

# Contents:

#### 2-body Gravity - Molecular Dynamics

Simulation of trajectories taken by two particles under the action of Gravity using Molecular Dynamics.

#### Binary alloy - Exchange Monte Carlo (XMC)

Simulation to obtain equilibrium structure of a hypothetical 2D binary alloy using the Exchange Monte Carlo technique.

#### Binary alloy w/ Vacancy - Kinetic Monte Carlo

Kinetic Monte carlo simulation of a vacancy in a 2D Binary alloy, using Kawasaki Dynamics.
